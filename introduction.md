operating system
----------------------
It is interface between computer system and computer user.

it communicate software and hardware.


software
------------
it is nothing but a computer program which is used to perform a particular task.

types of software
---------------------

1. system software
-----------------------
software which help the system to run.

2. application software
-----------------------------
software which help application to run.

ex: ms office.t

WHAT IS LINUX
----------------------
Linux is open source, multitasking, multiuser operating system.

HISTORY OF LINUX
-------------------
Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel.
Linux uses most of its tools from GNU software and are under GNU copyright. In 1992, he released the kernel under GNU General Public License.

COMPONENTS OF LINUX O.S
----------------------------
1. KERNEL : Linux kernel is the core part of the operating system. It establishes communication between devices and software
FOUR major responsibilities of kernel:
                                    Device management
                                    Memory management
                                    Process management
                                    Handling system calls
                                   
2. System library : It contains some special programs that help in accessing the kernel’s features.
3. Utility tools : Linux O.S has set of utility tools, which are usually a simple command.
4. Development tools : It contains the programs which is majorly use to update our system.

LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS
---------------------
It is an os that is made up of a collection of software based on linux kernel or say distribution contains the linux kernel & supporting libraries & software

ubuntu
Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Kali
Arch Linux
MX linux
Rocky Linux
Fedora


DIFFERENCE B/W LINUX AND WINDOW
------------------------------------
LINUX: open source
       free
       free software
       secure
       no virus and malware
       Low Hardware cost
       customizable add feature

WINDOWS : closed source
          costs $150-$320
          cost software
          insecure
          virus and malware
          high hardware cost
          not  customizable


commands
-------------

it is a way to give intruction to system.
